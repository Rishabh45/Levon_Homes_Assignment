### Overview
This SQL script models a Bill of Materials (BOM) hierarchy for manufacturing assemblies, calculates raw material requirements for single or bulk production orders, and supports scalable inventory planning. It uses relational tables to map components, materials, and parent-child dependencies, enabling dynamic queries for material aggregation. Ideal for inventory management, cost estimation, and production optimization workflows.

### Objectives
- Model hierarchical BOM relationships to map parent-child dependencies between assemblies and components.
- Calculate raw material requirements for single or bulk production orders using dynamic SQL queries.
- Support scalable inventory planning by aggregating material needs across multiple assemblies.
- Enable efficient production workflows by identifying shared components (e.g., Sub-Assembly C) to minimize redundancy.
- Facilitate data-driven decision-making for inventory management, cost estimation, and resource allocation.
